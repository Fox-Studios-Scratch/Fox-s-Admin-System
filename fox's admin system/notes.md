Need To Add:
Ban/Mute/Rank Tracking: For persistent commands like ban, mute, or setting ranks, datastores are needed to track these across server session. These need to be added in asap!

Roblox Support:
Need to make it so the code actually works with roblox. We should try having a roblox model pull the code from this repository & use it in-game, like Adonis Admin & HD Admin.
